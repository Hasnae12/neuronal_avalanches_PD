# Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by severe motor symptoms that can be transiently relieved by medication (e.g. levodopa). These symptoms are mirrored by widespread alterations of neuronal activities across the whole brain, whose characteristics at the large scale level are still poorly understood. To address this issue, we measured the resting state activities of 11 PD patients utilizing different devices, i.e deep brain stimulation (DBS) contacts placed within the subthalamic nucleus area, and EEG electrodes placed above the motor areas. Data were recorded in each patient before drug administration (OFF-condition) and after drug administration (ON-condition). Neuronal avalanches, i.e. brief bursts of activity with widespread propagation, were detected and quantified on both types of contacts, and used to characterize differences in both conditions. Of particular interest, we noted a larger number of shorter and smaller avalanches in the OFF-condition, and a lesser number of wider and longer avalanches in the ON-condition. This difference turned out to be statistically significant at the group level. Then, we computed the avalanche transition matrices (ATM) to track the contact-wise patterns of avalanche spread. We compared the two conditions and observed a higher probability that an avalanche would spread within and between STN and motor cortex in the ON-state, with highly significant differences at the group level. Furthermore, we discovered that the increase in overall propagation of avalanches was correlated to clinical improvement after levodopa administration. Our results provide the first cross-modality assessment of aperiodic activities in PD patients, and the first account of the changes induced by levodopa on cross-regional aperiodic bursts at the individual level, and could open new avenues toward developing biomarkers of PD electrophysiological alterations.
